#### Varchar and char are use for store character data. the bot have minor difference in functionality but it's impect is signeficant. such as varchar is use for variable length string while CHAR is use for fixed length string.In CHAR if character length is less then the declarated length,it add extra padding to fill up the gap. where VARCHAR don't put extra padding to fillup them.As CHAR has fixed lenght, so in query it is slightly faster compare to VARCHAR.
